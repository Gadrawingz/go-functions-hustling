## Benefits of Using Functions

Here are the benefits of using a function in programming:

### 1. Code Reusability
We can reuse the same function multiple times in our program.

### 2. Code Readability
Functions help us break our code into chunks to make our program readable and easy to understand.
It also makes the code easier to maintain and debug.
